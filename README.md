## 📈 AI Stock Trading Bot with Backtesting (Python)

A beginner-friendly AI-powered stock trading agent that uses machine learning and technical indicators to predict buy/sell signals and backtest trading strategies.

---

### 🚀 Features

* 📥 Fetches real-time historical stock data using `yfinance`
* 📊 Adds technical indicators like SMA-20 and SMA-50
* 🤖 Trains a simple machine learning model (RandomForest)
* 📉 Backtests strategy returns vs actual market
* 📈 Plots cumulative returns for visual comparison

---

### 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: Pulls stock price data (e.g., AAPL) via `yfinance`
2. **Strategy Logic**: Adds SMA indicators and signals based on crossovers
3. **Model Training**: Predicts future market movement with `RandomForestClassifier`
4. **Backtesting**: Compares strategy returns vs market returns
5. **Plotting**: Shows performance using `matplotlib`
